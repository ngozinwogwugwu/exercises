# Queues
I'm creating a double ended queue here for my second [algorithms programming assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/queues/specification.php)

Double ended queues are data strutures that act as both stacks and queues. You can add objects to the front or back. You can pop objects off either end of the double ended queue
