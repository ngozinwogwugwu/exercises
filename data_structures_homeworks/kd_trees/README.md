# Kd-Trees
my homework solution for the [kd-trees programming assignment](https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/kdtree/specification.php)

## What's up with Kd Trees?
[Kd-Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) are a space partitioning data structure. I'm using it here to efficiently find points in the range of a rectangle


## How to run it yourself
```bash
python client.py
```

here's what should pop up (not exactly, though. The client generates a new set of points and a new rectangle every time you run it):
